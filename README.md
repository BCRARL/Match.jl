# Advanced Pattern Matching for Julia

Scala has some of the most advanced pattern matching machinery.  This
package is an attempt to mimic those capabilities in Julia.  Features
include:

* Matching against almost any data type with a first-match policy
* Deep matching within data types and matrices
* Variable binding within matches

## Installation
Within Julia, do:
```julia
Pkg.add("Match")
```

## Examples

The best way to see usage is probably with examples. 



```julia
